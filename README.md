DeadBot is an open source IRC bot which responds to commands/sayings run within any
channel he has joined. DeadBot provides the ability to the webmaster to modify
commands without the need to restart the bot. DeadBot also has special commands that
can be run by identified administrators which can be managed, and will also attempt
to rejoin the channel in the event that he is kicked. DeadBot has an easy-to-use
setup wizard which you may use to easily install DeadBot and customize it
appropriately.

## No Longer Under Development ##
DeadBot was a project back from when I was first starting to explore the depths of
PHP for this kind of purpose. The project was started in 2011; since then I have
been focusing on lots of different projects, some of which involve PHP but I have
been looking into lots of other programming languages too. I've become I lot more
experienced in PHP since this project, and focused on CSS for designing sites. If
I ever do continue this project again, I would probably rewrite it from scratch.

Nevertheless, this project is no longer under development and is no longer
supported. My prototype bot is located in another branch. Thank you! ~Dead-i
