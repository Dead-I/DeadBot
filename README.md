## Currently Under Development ##
This stable version of DeadBot is currently under construction, therefore it may not
completely function correctly or as predicted. If you wish to use DeadBot as your own
IRC bot, you can try using the development project (Dead-i/DeadBot) on GitHub or wait
until the Stable version is complete. Thank you.
