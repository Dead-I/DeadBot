DeadBot is an open source IRC bot which responds to commands/sayings run within any
channel he has joined. DeadBot provides the ability to the webmaster to modify
commands without the need to restart the bot. DeadBot also has special commands that
can be run by identified administrators which can be managed, and will also attempt
to rejoin the channel in the event that he is kicked. DeadBot has an easy-to-use
setup wizard which you may use to easily install DeadBot and customize it
appropriately.

## Currently Under Development ##
This stable version of DeadBot is currently under construction, therefore it may not
completely function correctly or as predicted. If you wish to use DeadBot as your own
IRC bot, you can try using the development project (Dead-i/DeadBot) on GitHub or wait
until the Stable version is complete. Thank you.
